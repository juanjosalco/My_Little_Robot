# Deliverable 1: Machine state and CPU simulator

## Description of the problem
This project simulates the CPU of a robot, which recieves instructions regarding its movement through an assembly file previously generated by the compiler.

For the project, a C++ code will serve as the Robot CPU, which will read a file containing a set of valid instructions line by line, to then perform the corresponding instruction as long as it fits within the accepted area. The C++ code will then display in the terminal a 10x10 space, as well as the staring and ending point of the robot.

In case any given invalid instruction is read, the code will exit displaying an error. This also applies in case an instruction causes the robot to cross the accepted area.
